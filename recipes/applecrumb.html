    <p><h3>Apple Crumble Ingredients</h3></p>
    
        <p>These are the kitchen staples you'll need to make the best Apple Crumble of your life:</p>
      <ul> 
       <li><p>Butter: This classic chocolate chip cookie recipe starts with two sticks of butter creamed with white and brown sugars. The blend of sugars creates a perfectly balanced flavor.</p></li> 
       <li><p>Eggs: Eggs add moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dough together.</p></li>
       <li><p>Vanilla: Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the Apple Crumble.</p></li>
       <li><p>Baking soda: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.</p></li>
       <li><p>Water: A bit of hot water creates steam as it bakes, working with the baking soda to puff the cookies up.</p></li>
       <li><p>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cookies taste salty.</p></li>
       <li><p>Flour: All-purpose flour helps create gluten, which adds structure to the cookie dough.</p></li>
       <li><p>Chocolate chips: Of course, you'll need semisweet chocolate chips! You can use dark or milk chocolate chips if you prefer.</p></li>
       <p> <li>Nuts (optional): Walnuts are optional, but they add nutty flavor and a welcome crunch</p></li>
    </ul>
