    <p><h3>Chocolate Chip Cookies Ingredients</h3></p>
    
        <p>These are the kitchen staples you'll need to make the best chocolate chip cookies of your life:</p>
        
       <p>Butter: This classic chocolate chip cookie recipe starts with two sticks of butter creamed with white and brown sugars. The blend of sugars creates a perfectly balanced flavor.</p> 
        <p>Eggs: Eggs add moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dough together.</p>
        <p>Vanilla: Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chip cookies.</p>
        <p>Baking soda: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.</p>
        <p>Water: A bit of hot water creates steam as it bakes, working with the baking soda to puff the cookies up.</p>
        <p>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cookies taste salty.</p>
        <p>Flour: All-purpose flour helps create gluten, which adds structure to the cookie dough.</p>
     <p>   Chocolate chips: Of course, you'll need semisweet chocolate chips! You can use dark or milk chocolate chips if you prefer.</p>
       <p> Nuts (optional): Walnuts are optional, but they add nutty flavor and a welcome crunch</p>
